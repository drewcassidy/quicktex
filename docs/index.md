Quicktex is a Python library for encoding, decoding, and manipulating compressed textures. It uses a backend written in
C++ for superior performance, as well as an extensive API for low-level access to the texture data. The compression
engine is based in [rgbcx](https://github.com/richgel999/bc7enc).
